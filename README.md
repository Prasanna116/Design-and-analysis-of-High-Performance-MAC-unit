# Design-and-analysis-of-High-Performance-MAC-unit
This project presents the Design, Simulation, Synthesis, and Evaluation of various **Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units** using
** Multipliers: Vedic, Dadda, Wallace Tree **
**Adders: Kogge-Stone (KS), Brent-Kung (BK)  **

Each MAC variant is implemented for 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit datapath widths to study scaling behavior
